Oh aa.
Lage mainu har pal sona sang tu sathiya
Dil sadda Bhangra paave na paave boliyaan
Teri gall sunte hi lagge gungi duniya
Saari raat menu neend na aave, khuli ankhiyan

Aa. Maahiyaa.
Chadheya mainu ishq da bukhar
Ni bacha le mainu
Chadheya mainu ishq da bukhar

Ooh.
I was on the roads to nowhere
You show me the way
I wants to dance n feel free
Maybe I should dare
Should I open these doors and
Not be too scared
Should I let you win my heart
Will you promise me you'll stay
Promise me you'll stay
Promise me you'll stay
Promise me you'll stay
ooh...

Teri sohn kudiye
Chadheya mainu ishq da bukhar
Ni bacha le mainu
Chadheya mainu ishq da bukhar
